1. Setup your database.

Create a new database on your hosting account.
(Make sure that your MYSQL database user has privileges to INSERT, UPDATE,
REPLACE and LOCK TABLES.)

If you need detailed instructions for setting up a MySQL database, then these can be found 
in the manual / docs of your web hosting provider. Here is an overview of the steps:
 a. Create a new database
 b. Create a new database user
 c. Add the new MySQL user to the database, giving the MySQL user all privileges.


2. Upload all the script files to your server
This is best done with an FTP client such as FileZilla.
Please make sure to keep the original directory structure.


Set write permissions for the following directories: (chmod 777)

admin/temp/
pixels/

(Reason for the permissions: The script needs to be able to create images in the admin/temp/
and pixels/ directories)

Set write permissions to config.php (chmod 666). The script needs to write
to this file during installation and configuration.

Tips:
*nix via SSH: Change permissions from the command line using the "chmod" command. eg. chmod 777 pixels
*nix via FTP: Use an FTP client which allows you to set permissions. eg. Right click on the file.
See tutorials on www.milliondollarscript.com
Windows: Make sure the web-server/php process can write to pixels/ and admin/temp directories

3. Run the installation install.php script

Go to http://yourwebsite.com/admin/install.php

The installation script will install the database for you.
Fill in the database details from step 1.

Please delete the install.php file after successful installation.

4. Edit your configuration.

Go to http://yourwebsite.com/admin/ and use 'ok' as the default password

Here is what should configured:

 a. Main Config (Configuration menu.)
 b. Languages (Edit labels, email templates, etc using the editing tool)
 c. Payment Modules
 d. Currencies

 After configuration, go to 'Pixel Admin' and process pixels. Click on the
 'Process Images(s)' button to generate the images.

Additionally, you can set up your pixel inventory, prices, background blending, etc.
The admin has many possibilities, be creative ;)

5. Test the script.

If running the script for the first time, go to Admin and process the pixels from
the 'Pixel Admin' menu. 

Then look at example.html to see if the images were
installed correctly. Finally, sign up as a new user and make a test order.
You can set all the payment modules to demo mode if needed.

6. Create your site / integrate the script to your site. 
Look at example.html as an example of integration.


Note for C20 settings
The script requires C2O account version 2. Also you will need to set the return URLs
in your C20 account (under the Look and Feel). C20 agreement allows only one account per website,
so it is better to have  the script running on the same domain that you registered your C20 account with!


Note of PayPal settings
To get the Instant Payment Notifications to work, ensure that 
IPN is enabled for your PayPal account. Log into your paypal account and click
on 'Profile' -> 'Instant Payment Notification Preferences' and hit Edit.
Enter the URL of your website. (Any URL will do, the script will automatically tell PayPal
the URL when an order is made)

Tips for Use

> How to order without paying via Paypal / C20

1. Select some pixels to place them on the order. 
2. Confirm the order
3. Go into the admin/ and complete the order from the 'Orders Waiting' menu

Also, you can set an account to be in 'privileged mode, and the users
will never need to pay for the order.

##########################################################

> Sometimes people make orders but do not pay. What should I do?

The system keeps the pixels reserved for the client. If the client does not
complete the payment on time, you can delete the order from the
Admin. Deleting the order will free the pixels up for everyone else.
Non-paid orders are automatically cancelled after a number of days
as specified in config.

The script will also automatically delete unpaid orders after specified time.
The time can be specified in Main Config.

> Tips for Approving pixels & Processing the grid(s).

You should process your image(s) and publish it/them every time
AFTER approving your client's links.

##########################################################

> How do I log in to another user's account??


You can use the Admin password as the master password to log
in to a user's account.

The master password is the password that you have set in the config.
To log in, enter the users' username, and enter the master password.

##########################################################

> Can I edit the images for the blocks?

There are three different sets of images for blocks.
They are separated into the following directories.
You are welcome to edit them, but do not delete them - they
are needed by the script.


users/

block.png - available block
not_for_sale_block.png - Not for sale (white)
ordered_block.png - block on a confirmed order (orange)
reserved_block.png - reserved, but not confirmed yet. (yellow)
selected_block.png - Selected by user (green)
sold_block.png - completed order (red)

admin/

block.png - available block, used for preview
not_for_sale_block.png - the color of N.F.S. block for preview (green)
sold_block.png - sold block used for preview (red)

admin/temp/

block.png - available block, used for final processed grid  (white)
not_for_sale_block.png - N.F.S. block used for final processed grid (white)


##########################################################

> Having Problems generating the image?

99% of problems are due to the following:

1. Incorrect path and URL settings in Main Config. Please edit this carefully
and follow the recommendations

2. Permission problems. This is a common problem. Please check your permission settings.

3. Your PHP is too old. Check to make sure you have at least 4.3.9

4. The files were not uploaded with the original directory structure in tact.

5. Have you approved the pixels? Pixels need to be approved before they are
processed.

6. Don't delete any files from the admin/temp directory

######################################################

> I change header.php and footer.php, but there is no effect. Why?

The files forgot.php, signup.php, validate.php and the login form (login_functions.php) 
do not use the header and footer files because they external from the 'main' application.
Please modify the header tags directly in these files. Note that the css file
still affects these files.



######################################################

> I am getting 'page not found' error when i'm trying to process the pixels.

The cause is incorrectly compiled PHP on the server which is causing PHP to
crash when using the GD library bundled with PHP.
 
The problem is described here: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=29568
See the 2nd last comment: 

 "pdflib uses a bundled version of png (old version), which makes php
 (using newer png) crash. Either remove --with-pdf when compiling PHP, or
 compile pdflib with "--with-pnglib --with-zlib" to make pdflib use the
 newer png version."


Please try to upgarde your PHP, or disable pdflib from PHP.

######################################################



> I am getting an error: "Fatal error: Call to undefined function imagecreate()"

If you are hosting on Windows then it means that you do not have the GD library turned on. 
 
Please see PHP the documentation to learn how to enable extensions in Windows.

Roughly, here is what you need to do:
 
1. Copy the file php_gd2.dll from your PHP's ext/ directory to where
you have your php extensions. (No need to copy if php_gd2.dll is in the extension 
dir already. Look in php.ini for 'extension_dir' directive to 
find what is your current extension directory)
 
2. Modify your php.ini and change the following line:
 
;extension=php_gd2.dll
 
to:
 
extension=php_gd2.dll
 
3. Restart your web server.


######################################################

> I would like to approve the links one at a time.

This is not possible.

Links are grouped by advertiser, and all links for that advertiser need
to be approved in one go. This makes things simple and faster to administer.

Why are the links grouped?

If you approve each link individually then the images might end up 
looking like Swiss cheese. This is because an image can have different 
links, and if you don't approve some, then you will end up having holes in the image.
Grouping them eliminates this problem.

########################################################

> My background image too big and I cannot upload it. What can I do?

PHP may limit upload file size to 2MB by default and will not let you to
upload a background image via the admin.

You can upload the image by FTP.

Upload the file to the admin/temp directory

Then, rename the file to background1.png (The number 1 is to identify that the background
is to be used with the first grid. Rename to background2.png if you want to
identify with the 2nd grid and so on)

You will be able to see the background in the Admin after it is uploaded.

########################################################

> My hosting company does not allow me to set chmod 777 permissions

Does the script show any problem, saying that it cannot write to a directory
or file? If it does not, then everything is OK.

If it cannot write to a directory or file and you can only set to 666, then 
try to do this:

Create empty files with the following names:

in admin/temp/

temp1.png
temp1.jpg
temp1.gif
background1.png

in pixels/

main1.png
main1.jpg
main1.gif

Then give chmod 666 to all the files above.

These files can be just plain text files. For example upload myfile.txt and 
rename to temp1.png, upload myfile.txt and rename to temp1.jpg, and so on...

The above example creates the files for grid 1. If you have a 2nd grid, replace
the 1 with a 2, and so on..

###################################################

> I get error SQL when registering a new user

The script is written for MySQL version 4 or below. 
It does not support the recently released version 5.
 
This problem can also be solved by opening the file 'my.ini' in your MySQL 
install folder - the config file. And commenting out the command near the 
top that turns on the 'strict' mode.

>> -gl

####################################################

> I get errors that look like this: 
> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted
> (tried to allocate 3000 bytes)

It looks like your PHP memory limit is set to 8MB and the script needs more. 
Please contact your hosting service to increase the limit.
Increasing to 12MB usually helps.

If you are running apache, you can try this:

Create a .htaccess file in your web directory (or modify if the file is 
there) and add the following line to the file:

php_value memory_limit 16M



If your hosting accound does not support .htaccess, add the following
line to include/functions.php file below the first <?php line:

ini_set('memory_limit', '12M');


If that does not work, then how big is your grid??
The script can get very thirsty if there are more than 10,000 blocks
per grid (1 million pixels) so check if you didn't set it to something
really big! Or...you may have a really big background image that's 
causing the trouble.

> When I tried running the installation install.php script, 
> I got these notices. I'm unable to install database
>
> Notice: Use of undefined constant action - assumed 'action' 
> in d:\accounts\millionpix\admin\install.php on line 3


It looks like you have Notices turned on in your PHP php.ini file. 
This occurs when you first install php on your server, and the notices are 
turned on by default.

Notices should always be turned off in production environments.

Please edit your php.ini file and make sure that the error_reporting directive
is set to:

error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT

Please make sure to restart your web server after editing the php.ini file.
