IMPORTANT: IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU BACKUP ALL YOUR OLD
FILES AND DATABASE BEFORE ATTEMPTING AN UPGRADE. YOU SHOULD ALSO
KNOW HOW TO RESTORE YOUR BACKUP JUST IN CASE THINGS GO WRONG.


Basically, it is possible to upgrade your existing site
with this new version. Your database will be upgraded
automatically after uploading the files, when you go
to your Admin section.

The upload procedure is the same as in previous upgrades.

However, because the header and css files were modified
in version 2.0 - you would need to merge these files with
your existing files too.

The changes are too big to list right now.... 
The script's zip file more than doubled in size!

Upload all the files with the latest date, except:

- config.php

- users/header.php 
- users/footer.php

The script will upgrade the database automatically once
you log into the Admin section.

The script will also update the language file(s) in the lang/ directory.
The script will warn you if it cannot write to these files.

NOTE: Backup your files and database tables before attempting an upgrade.
You can backup the database tables by exporting them as SQL in PHPMyAdmin.

NOTE 2: If you have customized any other PHP files, you will need to merge them.
We recommend this handy tool for the job (free):
